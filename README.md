2. Von Neumann model, machine language, assembler  
3. Evolution of computer hardware/software, Intel and AMD 32/64 architectures  
4. CPU operating modes (kernel and user modes)  
5. Main memory  
6. Data structures and registers  
7. Instruction execution cycle  
8. Control flow instructions  
9. Assembly-level programming basics  
10. Parameter passing, ABI, system services  

And more advanced topics in CPU instruction encoding, I/O, cache, pipeline processing, multithreading, and memory hierarchy.
